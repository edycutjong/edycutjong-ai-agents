# Dependency Vulnerability Monitor

An AI-powered agent that continuously monitors project dependencies for new CVEs, prioritizes them by severity, and auto-creates fix PRs.

## Features

- **Multi-Ecosystem Support**: Scans `package-lock.json` (npm), `requirements.txt` (pip), `Cargo.lock` (cargo), and `go.mod` (go).
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Checks dependencies against CVE databases.
- **AI-Powered Remediation**: Uses LLMs to suggest fixes and generate PR descriptions.
- **Reporting**: Generates comprehensive vulnerability reports.
- **Premium UI**: Modern Streamlit interface with dark mode.

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

## Testing

Run tests with pytest:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Architecture

- `agent/`: Core logic (Parsers, Scanner, Advisor).
- `prompts/`: System prompts for the AI agent.
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests.
- `main.py`: Streamlit entry point.
