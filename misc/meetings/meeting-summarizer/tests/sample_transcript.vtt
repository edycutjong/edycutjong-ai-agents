00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Alice: Okay, let's get started. The main goal today is to decide on the database for the new project.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Bob: I think we should go with PostgreSQL. It's robust and open source.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Charlie: I agree. We already have experience with it.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Alice: Sounds good. Decision made: PostgreSQL.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Bob: Also, we need to update the API documentation by next Friday.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Alice: Charlie, can you take that?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Charlie: Sure, I'll update the API docs.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Alice: Great. I'll draft the project timeline.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Bob: I'm feeling really optimistic about this project.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Charlie: Me too!

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Alice: Anything else?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Bob: No.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Alice: Meeting adjourned.
